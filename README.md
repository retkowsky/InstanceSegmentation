# Instance Segmentation Custom Vision Model with AutoML for Images

This repo contains some Python Notebooks that uses AutoML for Images for building and training Instance Segmentation models with Azure ML.


AutoML is an Azure Machine Learning feature, that empowers both professional and citizen data scientists to build machine learning models rapidly. Since its launch, AutoML has helped accelerate model building for essential machine learning tasks like Classification, Regression and Time-series Forecasting.

With the preview of AutoML for Images, there will be added support for Vision tasks. Data scientists will be able to easily generate models trained on image data for scenarios like Image Classification (multi-class, multi-label), Object Detection and Instance Segmentation.

AutoML for Images is currently in Public Preview.<br>
